# Why did I make this?

The goal of this application was to create a web app to help me estimate the cost of plants at a local plant nursery.

While looking through their website I found a file that had all of their products and prices listed but there wasn't any functionality to add items to a cart. So I decide to build the tool myself and use it as an opportunity to relearn Redux and Tailwind.

All of the data is from https://www.perennials-plus.com/

# What I learned

- Redux
- Data Persistence with redux
- Tailwind
